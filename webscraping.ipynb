I've had this laptop for a couple weeks now and it has worked almost flawlessly. Only glitch is if I leave it for awhile and it goes into sleep mode, it doesn't always wake up properly and runs sluggish. If I restart it, it's fine. That is the only problem I've had. I've had quite a few computers and few have run this well. It's fast to start and has quick performance. Works well running video & audio programs. No WiFi connection problems. Automatically connects everytime. I'm not overly impressed with the sound quality when I have speakers plugged into it; sound is just average, but it's clear. Built in speakers are pretty good for a laptop.Display is average. Not 1080 but good enough.For a $400 laptop, I'm impressed enough to recommend it. 2 thumbs up.\"},\n",

No scratches when received, it started right up from the get go, internet was easy as can be. The laptop runs really great, perfect for my needs, no longer in school. I really love this laptop, its super fast compared to the last one (which was really old, and used a lot). I don't have any complaints. I was concerned with the size of the screen, since its bright, there are no problems. Picture is fantastic, sound is great for what I use it for. Lost the speakers in my previous Dell Laptop.\"},\n",

       "  'Review': 'Edit: As of May 29th I am returning this laptop, I upgraded it to 16GB of RAM, a WiFi 6 wireless card… and it was getting slower as time went on. Not your typical clean up type slow but everything ran like dirt.The battery was at end of life when I got it and I wasn’t too happy about that, but then the back USB port was flaky.  I went to use it on my car to scan the way the car was running, I flashed a new tune into it and drove to work for 19 minutes without a problem.I go to turn ot on and it’s dead!  I will not power on, I tried all the troubleshooting ideas I could find online. Doesn’t work with or without the battery nor when it’s on AC power.As I read around on this model it seems to be a common issue where they will be working fine one time and the next dead as a door nail.I already put a return in for it due to the battery and the USB port, and the next day it dies.Thankfully I had OneDrive installed and synced to my other Dell laptop so I didn’t lose much data… I put the old ram back in and the old wifi adapter. Plus side is I don’t have to worry about wiping my data off of it!Don’t buy! Look for a better model. I went with an E7470, i7 6600, 16GB of RAM already installed and a 512GB SSD drive.  Twice the specs of this model for $45 more.I have a Dell M4700 mobile workstation and it weighs over 8 pounds fully loaded!  I wanted something a bit lighter that I could use when I didn’t need the performance of the M4700. The i5 isn’t slow but the two downsides are it doesn’t support Win 11 and the WiFi card that is in it doesn’t support WiFi 6 networks, it won’t even see them and Intel doesn’t support it anymore so no updated drivers.I spent $29 on new card that supports WiFi 6 AX-3000 which should make it very fast'},\n",

       "  'Review': \"The packaging was fine, the computer looked very good. However, as soon as I opened the box I noticed the characteristic smell of burning/burned electronics, even though the computer was obviously turned off. I assumed it was from the storage where it came from. Anyway, I went ahead and plugged it in the power to charge the battery before I tried to use it. The smell got a little worse, and I still ignored it as I wasn't seeing anything of concern (e.g. smoke, sparks, etc.).After some minutes charging, I noticed that the upper left corner on the keyboard was getting hotter and the smell was coming from there. I thought that the hotter temperature inside was making the smell worse, and I assumed the the charging process was heating up the computer and that it was normal.After some more minutes I decided to turn it on, but for my surprise nothing happened, the power button didn't work at all and the computer seemed dead. I unplugged it, removed the batter and put it back, press the power button again and this time it worked and the computer turned on. Weird, but ok.While booting I pressed F2, checked the BIOS for log messages and there were some related to overheating. Can't tell for sure if this is related because the date/time was way off and I hadn't checked/updated the clock yet. I got concerned though.Unplugged it, rebooted it and let it run Windows update while on battery. When the battery reached ~50% (1h+ remaining), I got an alert saying that the battery was low and the system would shut down. I quickly plugged the power adapter, but it seems that it didn't do anything. Windows update could not even complete all the installations before the computer shut down.Checked the BIOS again and now it said the charger was not detected, but it was plugged into the coputer and to the power. BIOS also reported that the CPU fan was working fine. I used a digital multimeter to test the charger and it's output voltage was ok. More weird.Bottom line, I couldn't recharge the battery neither run on power because the adapter wasn't being detected. I bet the burning smell was coming from the internal circuit that connects the power adapter. The end result is that I can't use the computer at all.In the end I decided to stop troubleshooting and return the item before I had more unpleasant surprises. I went online and bought a brand new one from Dell (still waiting for it to be delivered).\"},\n",

The machine had been recently re-imaged without Dell add-ware/bloat-ware. It came with W10 1903 including all recent updates. On seeing the internet for the first time, the only thing it downloaded was 3 driver updates!! The laptop itself is usual high quality Dell, indistinguishable from new, and probably better (newer image) than if bought direct from Dell. No trouble with W10 activation. Came with an upgraded power brick (has a lighted ring on the plug). Of course the SSD makes everything fly. Refurbisher packaging was excellent with useful, clear contact info that I did NOT have to use.\"}]"
